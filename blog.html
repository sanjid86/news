              <p>In the early days of JavaScript, there was only one way to declare variables and that was using the var keyword. However, there were some issues associated with variables declared using the var keyword so it was necessary to evolve new ways for variable declaration. With the advent of ES6, now developers are able to define variables according to their specific needs, thanks to two new keywords: let and const. All three of these three keywords have similarities in their syntax for declaring variables. However, they differ in their usage and scope, as detailed in the next section.</p>

              <p>Regular functions created using function declarations or expressions are constructible and callable. Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the new keyword.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, the arrow functions are only callable and not constructible, i.e arrow functions can never be used as constructor functions. Hence, they can never be invoked with the new keyword.</p>

                filter does not update the existing array it will return a new filtered array every time.

              <p>Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, for string interpolation with embedded expressions, and for special constructs called tagged templates.

                Template literals are sometimes informally called template strings, because they are used most commonly for string interpolation (to create strings by doing substitution of placeholders). However, a tagged template literal may not result in a string; it can be used with a custom tag function to perform whatever operations you want on the different parts of the template literal.</p>
